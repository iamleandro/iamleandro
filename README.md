## Hi there, ðŸ‘‹

### Welcome to my GitHub profile :smiley:

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a really cool product @ [Benji](https://betterwithbenji.com). Stay tuned!  
ðŸŒ± After a long time building products and solving problems using C# and all Azure related ecosystem, I am now learning every day a new thing with Go and GCP.  
ðŸ‘¯ I love to learn new things. **I mean it!** If you are learning about something cool and need a bud to learn with, please [reach](https://www.linkedin.com/in/leandrodepaula-dev/) out.
