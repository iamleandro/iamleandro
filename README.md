## Hi there, ğŸ‘‹

### Welcome to my GitHub profile :smiley:

ğŸ”­ I mostly build commercial applications but I am looking for a nice project I am deeply interested in to contribute.  
ğŸŒ± Currently, I spend time reading white papers and I have developed an interest in computer architecture, kernels, compilers and network.  
ğŸ‘¯ I love to learn new things. **I mean it!** If you are learning about something cool and need a bud to learn with, please [reach](https://www.linkedin.com/in/leandrodepaula-dev/) out.
